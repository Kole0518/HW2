        <li>Game / Application Development</li>
        <p>
            In my free time, I am teaching myself how to 
            design videogames from the gorund up using
            popular game engine software.
        </p>
        <li>Digital Art & Design</li>
        <p>
            I am actively learning how to create different kinds of digital art
            and design for both personal game project purposes and otherwise.
            I frequently create mods for existing game software for people to use.

        <li>Hololens Application Research</li>
        <p>
            I am part of a GU campus research team working on developing
            AR software for the Microsoft Hololens 2.
        </p>
        <li>University Club Management</li>
        <p>
            I spent a good amount of time fulfilling my duties as the

            Gonzaga.
